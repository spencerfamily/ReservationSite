# Site for managing requests to the Camp.
Currently set up to allow users to create accounts either basic ones, or those backed by Google account.

## Setup instructions
- need to add user secrets to enable the SQL connection and Google Auth items (Ask HerrickSpencer if needed)

## Future plans: 
- Add other auth providers
- setup accounts to be admin vs customer
- add fullcalendar.io month view to show blocked time, or to select a date range for user to rent
